npio is a C library for reading and writing `.npy` files.

It supports arrays with a single data type, i.e., not [structured
arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html).

# Why?

To communicate data with Python without adding a large dependency,
while eliminating the risk of silly mistakes that can happen when
sharing raw data files with no encoded metadata.

# Status

For what has been done, see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quirks

- Always saves arrays with `'fortran_order': False`, i.e. up to the
  user to navigate around this if it is a problem.

- Ignores the byte order. The code is only run on little endian
  machines (AARCH64, x86_64) (to do).

## To do

- Decide for a better way to communicate errors without relying on
  `stdout`.

- Facilitate memory mapping of the data.

- Load data to a user-provided buffer.

- NPZ support using libzip.

## Will not

- Supported nested arrays, and for the same reason there is no point
  in supporting Numpy files of version 2.0 ( > 65535 bytes header
  length).


## Examples

Start with
``` c
#include <npio.h>
```

Open an npy file and print the some info to stdout:

``` c
npio_t * np = npio_load(filename);
if(np)
{
   npio_print(stdout, np);
   npio_free(np);
}
```

Write an array to a file:

``` shell
npio_write("array.npy",
           ndim, &shape,
           array,
           NPIO_F32, NPIO_F32);
```



## Build and install
To build and install as a shared library, use the `CMakeLists.txt`:

``` shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
```

Alternatively copy and add `npio.h`, `npio.c` and `npio_config.h` to
your project.

## Validation

Some self-tests can be run with `./npio --unittest`. A few more cases
are covered by the Python script `npio_test_suite.py`.
